## Hospital-Mangement-System

** AIM:**
      
      The main aim of the project is to provide paper-less hospital work up to 90%. So an automated version of the manual system has been developed.
      
 **DESCRIPTION:**
 
      This system includes the registration of inpatients and outpatients. It allows the admin to add new doctor,new staff, new lab and new bill details. In addition it also allows the admin to delete a specific doctor and specific staff when they resign or leave for one or more reasons. It gives access to the admin to update the room details whenever a patient gets admitted and when the patient gets discharged. The overall labs present in the hospital can be known by clicking a button "lab-details" in the lab page which is directed after clicking the lab button. It provides the facility for the admin to calculate the total bill amount by clcking the "payment" button in the bill page. The whole process is conducted by the adminsistrator.
